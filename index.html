				<h1><b>Draft example pages for the Bluebell Railway Museum Website and/or Interactive Display</b></h1>

		<h1><a class="link-primary" href="timeline.html">Bluebell Railway Timeline</a></h1>
		<p><b>For the Website and/or Interactive Display</b> Developed using the same standard web page software as the museum website (HTML,CSS,JS) + US North Western University's <a class="link-primary" href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">Knightlab open source Timeline package.</a> Very easy to adapt the content. Look and feel can be adapted but within limits. Would work on an interactive screen:- Swipe left and right on the pages and/or manipulate the timeline in the footer. Content of this example requires further work and rationalisation. Very easy to apply to other content, for example, a timeline with a page for each of the LBSCR CMEs, a timeline for each of the Bluebell railway locomotives, a timeline for key museum exhibits in chronological order and so on. </p>

		<h1><a class="link-primary" href="storymap.html">Bluebell Railway Storymap</a></h1>
		<p><b>For the Website and/or Interactive Display</b> Visitors can step along the Bluebell line to find out about the stations etc on the route. Similar to the timeline but uses the <a class="link-primary" href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/">Storymap package</a> rather than the Timeline package. Content shown is currently from Wikipedia. Basic content available to generate such storymaps for any route in the UK (e.g. could have storymaps for other LBSCR routes, named train routes such as the Atlantic Coast Express etc). Another example is <a class="link-primary" href="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/5c5314eba77316873d3676fa97da3136/the-warrington-and-altrincham-junction-railway/draft.html">here</a></p>

		<h1><a class="link-primary" href="gigamap.html">Museum Map</a></h1>
		<p><b>For Interactive Display</b> View a museum plan, key exhibits and get more info about the key exhibits. This example is a very rough draft, possibly with some software bugs. As no museum plan readily available, a plan of the Sheffield Park area has been used. This approach could also be used to display a map/plan from the archive and describe points of detail. A much better example from Knightlabs which shows how you can describe a museum exhibit can be seen <a  class="link-primary" href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/examples/bosch-garden/">here</a></p>

		<!-- <h1><a class="link-primary" href="photos_search.html">Photos Archive Search</a></h1>
		<p><b>Primarily for the website</b> Demonstrates a slightly improved search interface for the existing photos search page. Could be adapted for the Interactive Display; would require onscreen or physical keyboard search term entry. Catalogue already available but the thumbnails might not have the resolution needed for the larger Interactive Display</p>

		<h1><a class="link-primary" href="magazine_search.html">Magazine Archive Search</a></h1>
		<p><b>Primarily for the website</b> Similar to the photo archive search. Show hows a search facility might be implemented for the magazine catalogue. Could be used to search for people references across the catalogue (e.g. for geneaology purposes).</p> -->
