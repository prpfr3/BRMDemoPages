## Basics of Operation

The device can be powered on and off using the switch which is on the bottom edge of the screen just to the left of the power supply cord.

Ideally the device should be powered off using the settings option (see below) rather than by power switch. However, if the power switch is used it should not damage the device or the museum application.

The device is a touch screen, basically a large Android tablet. Certain screen options which may be needed for problem solving are disabled in order to improve and limit the visitor experience. These can be accessed using the remote control. In the event that the remote control is lost, then problems may only be solvable by switching the power off and restarting the screen, which will power up on the initial screen.

If the child lock has been inadvertently switched on, the pin code to unlock can be entered on the remote as ‘2580’ (i.e. a vertical line down the centre of the numbers on the remote) or can be tapped on the numeric pad shown on the screen.

The device settings can be accessed in one of three ways:-

- Whilst on the home screen, by swiping from the left hand edge of the screen frame and then tap the settings cogwheel for all of the settings:-
- By clicking menu on the remote
- By tapping the ‘More App’ on the first screen and then the settings cogwheel on the subsequent screen
  In all cases, the screen below is reached. Normally this screen should only be needed if, for example, new Wifi settings have to be entered (which would be under the network option)

Tap ‘Exit’ to exit the settings

## The Museum Application

The application is a set of web pages on the Internet which can be accessed through any browser, but the ‘Fully Kiosk Browser’ is used as it is a kiosk browser that hides the usual clutter of the browser. The Internet has to be accessible via WiFi for the application to work.

To start the museum application tap on the ‘More App’ icon on the initial page.

On the next screen tap on the ‘Fully Kiosk Browser’ icon.

The museum application starts up. Any of the three sub-applications can be accessed by tapping ‘Enter Now’.

Operation of the museum application is relatively straightforward. Left and Right arrows navigate through the content of the sub-applications. The ‘House’ icon returns you to the main menu.

There is one complication with the ‘Travel the Route’ sub-application. On entering the application the visitor is told to ‘Swipe to Navigate’ and must click ‘OK’ to clear the message. It may not be obvious to the visitor that the swipe should be on the right hand side of the screen. Swipes on the left hand side of the screen are used to move around the map. There are also left and right arrows that can be used instead of swiping.

Note that you can also ‘stretch’ the screen on all of the applications using two fingers, just as you can on a standard tablet or phone. This is useful for viewing the detail of photos etc but may lead to the navigation icons moving off the screen, so the visitor will need to return the screen magnification to standard to see them again.

Swiping left to right on the left hand edge of the device whilst in the Fully Browser may reveal the browser setting controls. Swiping right to left hides these again. A visitor could potentially open up the browser to other sites using this.

There are two ways to exit the museum application on the Fully browser:-

- press ‘Home’ on the remote control
- swipe in from the left hand edge to get to the browser controls and ‘Exit Fully’

The museum application has been programmed to return to the Home Screen after 5 minutes, so it should not be necessary to reset the application every time.
