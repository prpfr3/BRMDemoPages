When built, it was the straightest and quickest route from Lewes to London.</p><It>Construction was authorised by Parliament in 1877 as the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway. It was sponsored by local landowners including the Earl of Sheffield. A year later another act enabled the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway to acquire and operate the line.</p><p>A 4.5 mile link line was also built between Horsted Keynes and Haywards Heath to join the London to Brighton main line, with a station at Ardingly.</p><p>Designed under instructions from the Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the line was constructed to take double track. However, only the section between East Grinstead and Horsted Keynes (and thence to Haywards Heath via Ardingly) was laid as such; south of the junction at Horsted Keynes the line was single track with passing loops at stations. The line was opened in 1882.</p><p>Goods traffic on the line consisted of local produce; milk: farm products and coal, and timber to and from Albert Turner &amp; Son, a sawmill. The only time Sheffield Park received a substantial number of passengers was when Lord Sheffield entertained the Australian cricket team, with a match between them and Lord Sheffield's own team.</p><p>British Railways closed the line in May 1955 but after a challenge from Margery Bessemer of Chailey based on the original acts, the line was reopened in August 1956 and a public inquiry followed.</p><p>The line finally closed on March 1958 but was reopened by the Bluebell Railway society on August 7th 1960 to become the first preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world.</p>"}},
