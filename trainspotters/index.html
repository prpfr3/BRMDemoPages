        <h1>Trainspotters</h1>
        <p>Our latest exhibition looks at the subculture of trainspotting which reached its' heyday in the 1950s. See the exhibits referred to here at the far end of the museum</p>
        <!-- <ul class="list-keydates">
          <li>1830: FIRST FOOTPLATE RIDE. Shortly after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester railway, young actress Fanny Kemble rides on the footplate of Rocket. She wrote 'when I closed my eyes, the sensation of flying was quite delightful, and strange beyond description'.</li>
          <br>
          <li>1841: FIRST SPOTTING RECORDS. A diary, believed to belong to Colonel James Pennyman of Ormesby Hall, shows detailed records of trains on the Great North of England Railway from 1841 to 1847. </li>
          <br>
          <li>1861: JOURNAL OF LOCOMOTIVE NUMBERS. The first person to keep records of locomotive numbers and names in a separate journal was 14-year-old Fanny Johnson in 1861.</li> 
          <br>
          <li>1899: PRINTED COMPENDIUMS OF NUMBERS. The first major compendium appears to be an alphabetical list of named engines by S Cotterell and GH Wilkinson for the London & North Western Railway (LNWR).</li>
          <br>
          <li>1934: LOCOMOTIVES OF THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY PUBLISHED. This was one of a number of publications by the Big Four railway companies aimed at satisfying the needs of 'locoists' and those collecting 'namers' (named locomotives).</li>
          <br>
          <li>1942: IAN ALLAN'S FIRST ABC SPOTTER BOOK PUBLISHED leading to a boom in trainspotting. The Ian Allan Locospotters' Club was formed in 1948 to help control the craze. These enthusiasts later formed the bedrock of support for heritage railways in Britain.</li>
          <br>
          <li>1953: SPOTTING'S HEYDAY. By the 1950s, trainspotting was extremely popular, and many unaccompanied youngsters could be found at stations. Some authority figures wanted to ban the hobby as they were concerned about the potential for juvenile delinquency.</li>

        <h1>Fanny Johnson - the first Trainspotter</h1>
        <h2>From the May 1935 edition of the Great Western Railway Magazine</h2>
        <i>
          <p>The hobby of observing and recording names of engines is one that is widely practiced, and nowhere do its devotees display more enthusiasm than at towns and villages adjacent to the Great Western Railway. Many of our readers will have engaged in this fascinating past-time in their boyhood days.</p>
          <p>In their “boyhood” days, we say, for one has always presumed this to be an enthusiasm of the male sex, whether old or young: but recently a simple little pocket-book, home-made by its owner 74 years ago, has come to the notice of the Magazine, and this indicates that one girl at least in the early days of railways found an absorbing interest in watching the engines of the Great Western Railway and recording their names.</p>
        </i>
        <p>Fanny was 14 years old when she started spotting. The cover of her 1861 spotting book lists the pages that the engine names appeared under. Where the top page of numbers refers to 'Narrow Gauge' it actually refers to today's standard gauge which was only used on the GWR from October 1861</p>

        <h1>Tales of a Trainspotter 1962 - Aged 15</h1>
        <i>
          <p>Living in Mitcham at the time, my day would start by taking the number 220 bus to Scrubs Lane where it crossed the Grand Union Canal. A short walk along the canal tow path brought me to the broken-down fence at the back of Old Oak Common engine shed. Old Oak Common, the main shed for Paddington, was easy to bunk. I visited dozens of times and was never thrown out. Willesden, a short walk away. Again, an easy shed to visit with the chance of a few cops. Being the main shed for Euston, something from the north might be on shed.</p>
          <p>Next on the list, Camden just outside Euston, always very difficult to bunk. Wait for the foreman’s phone to ring and if he turned to look at the board it might just be possible to get by. Sometimes a detour to Devon’s Road, Bow could be added to the trip, easy to bunk but usually nothing much there.</p>
          <p>Visits to Euston, Kings Cross and St Pancras stations ended the day. Looking at the information boards to see when the next express would arrive. Then home on the tube to Balham, electric train to Streatham Common and bus. Just time to update my Ian Allan combined.</p>

        <h1>Ian Allan (1922-2015)</h1>
        <p>The name Ian Allan is synonymous with trainspotting. He was born in 1922 and on leaving school worked in the Southern Railway Public Relations Office. There he received many requests from the public about the engines and rolling stock of the Southern Railway. In December 1942 he produced a notebook which was well received. With the, eventual, support of the Southern Railway management he went on to produce books for other companies, he called them ABCs.</p>
        <p>In 1945 Ian Allan resigned from the Railway to form his own publishing company, which after a few moves had its offices by Shepperton Railway Station. The company went on to produce many 1000s of transport books and magazines.</p>
        <p>In 1946 Ian Allan founded Trains Illustrated magazine. The first 8 issues appeared irregularly during 1946 and 1947 due to problems with paper supply post-war. From February 1950 it was a monthly publication, and it was renamed Modern Railways in 1962.</p>
        <p>The photo shows Ian driving on the Great Cockcrow Railway at Lyne near Chertsey which he bought in 1960. This 7¼ inch gauge railway operates on Sundays between May and October.</p>
