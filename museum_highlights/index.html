        <h1>London Jack</h1>
<p>London Jack spent much of his life at Waterloo collecting money for the Southern Railway Orphanage at Woking. He was owned by SR Motor Driver Farley and when he was not working he and Jack met the trains at Waterloo. Jack was born in 1917 and started collecting in 1923. He retired at the end of 1930 and died on 22 June 1931. In that time he collected over £4500 for the Orphanage.</p><p>Jack was not alone. There were many dogs collecting around the Southern Railway area. When the dogs died they were stuffed and put on display at a station and continued to collect money for the Orphanage. In 1967 it was decided that Jack was not an appropriate feature of the newly electrified railway and so he was given a new home here at Sheffield Park.</p><p>The London and South Western Railway Servant’s Orphanage was founded by the Rev Canon Allen Edwards, the Railway Chaplin of Nine Elms, as a home for “fatherless girls” in Clapham in 1886. The Orphanage was expanded to cater for “fatherless boys” a few years later. In those days if a child’s father was killed or injured there was no Welfare State to look after the children and this is why the need for the Orphanage arose. The Orphanage moved to Woking in 1909 and when extended in the 1930s catered for 200 children.</p><p>Since arriving at the Bluebell Railway Jack has continued to collect money for the Woking Homes. In 2008 Jack was given a “facelift” as over the years he had become rather bedraggled.</p>
