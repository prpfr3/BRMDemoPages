        <h1>GWR 7800 'Manor' Class</h1>
        <p>The 7800 Manor is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive. They were designed as a lighter version of the earlier Grange Class, the lighter weight allowing them to run on cross-country and branch line routes forbidden to the heavier Grange and Hall classes. Twenty were built between 1938 and 1939 by the Great Western Railway, with British Railways adding a further 10 in 1950. They were named after Manors in the area covered by the Great Western Railway. Nine are preserved</p>
        <p>They used a new lighter (Swindon No.14) boiler, with some driving wheels and motion components being cannibalised from withdrawn members of the 4300 Class.</p>
        <h1>No. 7812 Erlestoke Manor</h1>
        <p>Built at Swindon Works in January 1939, 7812 was named after the Manor at Erlestoke, a village near Devizes in Wiltshire.After withdrawal from British Railways service in November 1965, it was sent to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales. The locomotive was purchased by the Erlestoke Manor Fund in June 1973. It was moved to the Severn Valley Railway where it entered service in 1979. Withdrawn in 1985, it returned to service on 12 February 2008, as part of the SVR's anniversary reopening train. At the end of 2017, the boiler certificate expired with 110,743 miles completed since preservation. After a further overhaul the locomotive returned to service in 2023.</p>

        <h1>GWR 5700 Pannier Class</h1>
        <p>The GWR 5700 or 57xx is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive built by the Great Western Railway and British Railways between 1929 and 1950. With 863 built, they were the most prolific class of the GWR, and one of the most numerous classes of British steam locomotive.</p>
        <p>Although officially designated by GWR as "light goods and shunting engines", they were also used for passenger working on branch, suburban, and shorter mainline journeys.</p>
        <p>The 5700s were not as large as the GWR Castle and King locomotives but became just as much of an icon of the GWR due to their iconic design and quantity.</p>
        <h1>No. 7714</h1>
        <p>No. 7714 was withdrawn in 1959 and sold to the National Coal Board. It was bought by the Severn Valley Railway in 1973 and was first steamed in 1992 after an extensive overhaul. Withdrawn from service in 2009, the engine re-entered service after overhaul in late November 2016.</p>

      <div class="slide-content">
        <h1>GWR 1366 Pannier Class</h1>
        <p>The Great Western Railway 1366 Class is a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotives designed by C.B.Collett and built in 1934. They were a useful design and because of their light weight and short wheelbase and were often used on dockside branches or other lines with sharp curvatures.</p>
        <p>The 1366 class was one of only two pannier tank designs built by the GWR that utilised outside cylinders. It was developed from the 1361 Class but differed by including a pannier tank rather than a saddle tank. Only six of the class were built.</p>
        <h1>No. 1369</h1>
        <p>1369 was completed at Swindon in February 1934 and cost £1979 plus £438 for her boiler. For much of her life, she worked at Swindon works, where she was used for shunting the extensive works facilities. In 1960, she was transferred to British Railways Southern Region stock to work the Weymouth Quay branch in Dorset. Whilst at Weymouth, the 1366 class locomotives there were fitted with brass bells for use when traversing the tramway-style branch. 1369 still sports its bell, although it is not the original which was stolen, but a replica recently manufactured.</p>
        <p>We are very grateful to the South Devon Railway and the South Devon Railway Association for allowing 1369 to join us at The Bluebell Railway for the 2024 branch line gala weekend.</p>

        <h1>GWR 6959 'Modified Hall' Class</h1>
        <p>The Great Western Railway (GWR) 6959 or Modified Hall Class is a class of 4-6-0 steam locomotive. They were a development by Frederick Hawksworth of Charles Collett's earlier Hall Class named after English and Welsh country houses.</p>
        <p>Although the GWR had been at the forefront of British locomotive development between 1900 and 1930, the 1930s saw a degree of complacency at Swindon with designs and production methods not keeping pace with developments elsewhere. Charles Collett was replaced as the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Railway by F.W. Hawksworth in 1941 who immediately created a modified version of the 4900 'Hall' class.</p>
        <h1>No. 6989 Wightwick Hall</h1>
        <p>Visiting on a long-term loan from the Buckinghamshire Steam Centre at Quainton Road, 6989 was completed in March 1948 at Swindon Works. During its BR career, 6989 was based at Hereford, Worcester and Gloucester Horton Road, where the engine would be used on a variety of different trains. It was eventually withdrawn from BR service in June 1964 and sold to Woodham Brothers scrapyard having done over 640,000 miles.</p>  
        <p>In 1978, the locomotive was purchased by the Wightwick Hall Restoration Group based at Quainton Road in Buckinghamshire. In December 2018 after a long restoration, the locomotive moved under its own steam once again, becoming the 150th locomotive from the Barry scrapyard to return to working order.</p>

        <h1>SECR Class O1</h1>
        <p>The South Eastern Railway (SER) O Class, some of which were later rebuilt as the O1 Class, was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive. They were designed for goods work, and were the main goods engines of the SER, and later the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) for a number of years. However, they were displaced by the more powerful C class locomotives and relegated to working on passenger and goods trains of the branch lines in Kent, most notably on the Kent & East Sussex Railway, on the East Kent Railway operating coal trains from the Kent coal fields to London and to shunting work. The majority were withdrawn before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, and those that remained were slowly withdrawn from nationalisation onwards.</p>
        <h1>No. 65</h1>
        <p>Built at Ashford as an 'O' class locomotive to a design already 18 years old, it received a rebuild to class 'O1' in 1908, and ran on until finally withdrawn in 1961. In 1963 it was obtained by the late Mr Lewis-Evans and kept at Ashford Steam Centre until its closure. For the following 20 years its whereabouts became something of a mystery (with boiler, frames and tender separated) until it was brought back together at the Bluebell Railway for overhaul, and was returned to steam for the centenary of the amalgamation of the SER and the LCDR in August 1999.</p>
        <p>The locomotive was purchased from the family of the late owner by the Bluebell Railway Trust in December 2021 and recently underwent an overhaul at Sheffield Park.</p>

        <h1>BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T</h1>
        <p>The British Railways Standard Class 4 tank is a class of steam locomotive, one of the BR standard classes built during the 1950s. They were used primarily on commuter and outer suburban services. They were capable of reaching speeds of 75 mph (121 km/h).</p>
        <p>On the decision to build the BR standard series of locomotives, a series of class four tank engines was ordered, basedwith some modifications on the ex-LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T and in turn the earlier Fowler design of 1927. Design work was done at Brighton, the overall programme being overseen by Robert Riddles.</p>
        <p>Between 1951 and 1956, 130 were built at Brighton, 15 at Derby Works and 10 at Doncaster Works. With the mass withdrawal of steam locomotive classes in the 1960s, older types were withdrawn in preference to the Standard 4s, whose class remained intact until 1964. The final nine were withdrawn from the Southern Region on 9 July 1967.</p>
        <h1>No. 80151 (80100 for the Gala Weekend only)</h1>
        <p>The 4MT tank locomotives were closely linked to the last years of the Bluebell line and the Bluebell now plays host to three members of the class, all one-time residents of Barry scrapyard. 80151 arrived from another preservation site in 1998 and returned to steam after the completion of its overhaul in the Bluebell’s workshops in October 2001.</p>
        <p>Its latest overhaul, which cost over half a million pounds saw, along with routine heavy maintenance and boiler work undertaken in-house, new tyres fitted to the driving wheels.</p>

        <h1>The Great Western Railway</h1>
        <p>The Great Western Railway (GWR) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest, west and West Midlands of England and most of Wales. It was founded in 1833, received its enabling act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 with the initial route completed between London and Bristol in 1841. It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who chose a broad gauge of 7 ft (2,134 mm)—later slightly widened to 7 ft 1⁄4 in (2,140 mm)—but, from 1854, a series of amalgamations saw it also operate 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) standard-gauge trains; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892.</p>
        <p>The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921, which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory, and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways.</p>
        <p>The GWR was called by some "God's Wonderful Railway" and by others the "Great Way Round" but it was famed as the "Holiday Line", taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon, Minehead in Somerset, and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall. The company's locomotives, many of which were built in the company's workshops at Swindon, were painted a Brunswick green colour while, for most of its existence, it used a two-tone "chocolate and cream" livery for its passenger coaches. Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey.</p>
